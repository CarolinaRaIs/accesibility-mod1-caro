# Website Accessibility: HTML & CSS Refactor

## Description

Its imperative that websites and applications are an ejoyable experience for everyone including those who may use additional assistive technology like screen-readers to manuever through technology. Horiseon is a digital marketing company that needed their website's code to be refactored to a more accessible version. The addition of alternative text for the images on the site will create a more accessible experience for all users and the consolidation of css styling rules will provide a cleaner and more concise source code. I learned that there is a difference between images on a screen that add value to the understanding of a page and images that are decorative that do not necessarily need alternative text. I also learned that identifying similar styling rules and grouping them together makes for a more organized css code.
